# Mark's Password Generator
An Android app that generates site-specific passwords using a word or sentence you type in. Remember word or sentence to generate/retrieve the same password again. A password vault that re-generates your passwords rather than storing them. 

Currently compiled for Android SDK API **34** (Android 14 UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE and above).

Currently this app is *not* available on the Play Store, but you can download the most recent APK from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/MarkStrendin/MarksPasswordGenerator/releases/latest/

# How the app works
You set up a unique "Master Key" that you never share with anyone.

You can then type in a word into the "input" field, and it will generate two long complex passwords, and provide you buttons to copy certain numbers of characters. You may change the provided passwords before copying them, if you want to add or remove custom parts of it for extra security.

This app allows you to remember simpler words (like "facebook") that translate into a strong(er) password that you can use for that service. All you need to remember is what your input string is for each service. The same input will always produce the same password.

# How does this improve security?
Nobody knows what you input for each password, so for example, for a password for Facebook, you might type in "facebook", "Facebook", "f.a.c.e.b.o.o.k.", "FaCeBoOk", "Facebook.com", "Mark-Facebook", "BookFace69" etc., and each of those will generate completely different passwords. I encourage you to choose something memorable for you, but not easily guessable by others.

Your Master Key means that passwords _you_ generate are unique from those generated by others, as long as your Master Keys are different. The app will generate a new random Master Key the first time it is started, but you may change this to anything you wish.

## ⚠️ Save your Master Key and store it in a safe place
Your "Master Key" is what makes your passwords unique from other people's. You will need to record your Master Key and transfer it (manually) to another phone if you want to use this. 

**It is not possible to recover your Master Key if you lose it**. If you have lost your Master Key, the passwords that this app generates will be different and you will be locked out of all of your accounts. **I am not able to help you with lost passwords or Master Keys, you use this app at your own risk.**

I would recommend writing or printing your master key and saving it in a secure location (like in a fire-proof safe or safe deposit box at your bank).
